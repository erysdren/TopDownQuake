Description		: Following through the entrance to the castle-turned-foundry, you find that you are not alone. There are endless wells of molten rock and metal everywhere you look, and a faint sense of melancholy in the abandoned crypts and caverns. At the end, there is an indescribable pit, from which surely nothing good will come from. You stand there, silent, at the grievance's precipice.

Additional Notes	: I'll be honest, I've been putting off entering the workforce. I'm 21 years old now, and I've yet to get a job. While I was working on this map, I got kicked out of my Mom's house. It's a miracle I was able to troubleshoot it, and "finish" it "in time". If there are things that look or feel unfinished, I know that there's no excuse for that, but at the very least I wanted to explain myself.
